<h1>Welding in Ms. Rommel&#39;s Room</h1>
<p>James Hotchkiss and welding apprentices from John Deere came to Ms. Rommel&#39;s class so her students could experience an augmented reality system.
 While they were here, the students were able to control an excavator and a welding simulator.  It was such a great experience that John Deere provided for the students!</p>
